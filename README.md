# Product Catalog Web Application Solution

## Introduction

This repository contains the solution for the Product Catalog web application development. The tasks were aimed at building a React JS application with specific features outlined in the provided  README.FILE.

## Assignments

### First Assignment

#### Main Screen

The main screen displays a list of products with their names, images, and relevant information. The product data is fetched from the online source [https://dummyjson.com/docs/products](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products).

#### Cart Functionality

Users can add products to a cart, specify the quantity, and save it locally.

#### Cart Screen and Operations

A cart screen shows a list of products chosen by the user. Users can delete products from the cart, change the quantity of products, and clear the entire cart.

#### Cart Icon

A cart icon is displayed in the navigation bar with a count that reflects any changes made to the cart.

#### GitHub Project and Commits

The development progress was organized using a GitHub project. Separate commits were made for each functionality, following the principles of Conventional Commit Messages ([Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)) and Atomic Change Commits ([Atomic Change Commits](https://medium.com/@fagnerbrack/one-commit-one-change-3d10b10cebbf)).

### Second Assignment

#### Language Support

Support for English and an additional language of choice has been implemented.

#### Tab Menu

A tab menu has been introduced with two items: "Products" and "Settings."

#### Language Switcher

A language switcher has been created in the Settings menu, allowing users to change the application's language.

### Third Assignment

#### Dark Mode

A dark mode feature has been implemented, changing the background color to a dark theme and adjusting text color accordingly.

#### Dynamic Updates

The app style dynamically updates when switching between light and dark modes without requiring a full restart.

### Optional Bonus Tasks

#### Responsiveness

The website has been made responsive to different screen sizes.

#### Toggle Button

A toggle button has been added to show the cart icon and language settings, particularly on mobile devices.
